# QuXAT Healthcare Quality Grid Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide provides comprehensive instructions for deploying the QuXAT Healthcare Quality Grid Scoring Dashboard to various cloud platforms.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- Git repository
- Account on chosen deployment platform

## Deployment Options

### 1. Streamlit Cloud (Recommended)
**Easiest deployment option for Streamlit apps**

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
3. Connect your GitHub account
4. Select your repository and branch
5. Set main file path: `streamlit_app.py`
6. Deploy!

**Environment Variables:**
- Set any required environment variables in the Streamlit Cloud dashboard
- Use the secrets management feature for sensitive data

### 2. Heroku
**Good for scalable web applications**

1. Install Heroku CLI
2. Login: `heroku login`
3. Create app: `heroku create your-app-name`
4. Deploy: `git push heroku main`

**Files needed:**
- `Procfile` ✅ (already created)
- `runtime.txt` ✅ (already created)
- `requirements.txt` ✅ (already optimized)

### 3. Google App Engine
**Google Cloud Platform deployment**

1. Install Google Cloud SDK
2. Initialize: `gcloud init`
3. Deploy: `gcloud app deploy`

**Files needed:**
- `app.yaml` ✅ (already created)

### 4. Docker Deployment

1. Build image: `docker build -t quxat-scoring .`
2. Run locally: `docker run -p 8501:8501 quxat-scoring`
3. Deploy to your preferred container platform

**Files needed:**

## Environment Configuration

### Production Environment Variables
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:
- Database connections (if applicable)
- API keys
- Feature flags
- Security settings

### Streamlit Configuration
- `config.toml` ✅ (optimized for production)
- `secrets.toml` ✅ (for sensitive data)

## Security Considerations
- Never commit sensitive data to version control
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Enable HTTPS in production
- Configure proper CORS settings
- Set up monitoring and logging

## Performance Optimization
- Caching is enabled in the application
- Static assets are optimized
- Database connections are pooled (if applicable)
- Memory usage is monitored

## Monitoring and Maintenance
- Set up health checks
- Monitor application logs
- Configure alerts for errors
- Regular dependency updates
- Backup data regularly

## Troubleshooting
- Check application logs for errors
- Verify environment variables are set
- Ensure all dependencies are installed
- Check network connectivity
- Validate data file accessibility

## Support
For deployment issues, check:
1. Application logs
2. Platform-specific documentation
3. Streamlit community forums
4. GitHub issues
