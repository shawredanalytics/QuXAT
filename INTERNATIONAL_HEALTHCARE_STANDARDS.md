## International Quality Metrics

### 1. Clinical Outcomes (30% weight)
- Mortality rates (risk-adjusted)
- Readmission rates
- Hospital-acquired infection rates
- Patient safety indicators
- Clinical effectiveness measures

### 2. Patient Experience (25% weight)
- Patient satisfaction scores (HCAHPS, CAHPS, regional equivalents)
- Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)
- Patient-reported experience measures (PREMs)
- Complaint resolution metrics

### 3. Operational Excellence (25% weight)
- Staff-to-patient ratios
- Average length of stay
- Bed occupancy rates
- Emergency department wait times
- Surgical site infection rates

### 4. Innovation & Technology (10% weight)
- Electronic health record adoption
- Telemedicine capabilities
- AI/ML implementation
- Digital health initiatives
- Research and development activities

### 5. Sustainability & Social Responsibility (10% weight)
- Environmental sustainability practices
- Community health programs
- Healthcare accessibility initiatives
- Staff diversity and inclusion
- Ethical practices and transparency

## Regional Adaptation Framework

### Principle: No Penalty for Regional Differences
- Hospitals are NOT penalized for lacking certifications from other regions
- Each region has its own compliance framework
- Global standards (JCI, WHO, ISO) are universally applicable
- Regional standards are bonus points, not requirements

### Regional Scoring Adjustments
1. **Developed Countries**: Higher weight on innovation and technology
2. **Developing Countries**: Higher weight on accessibility and basic care quality
3. **Rural Areas**: Adjusted expectations for technology and specialization
4. **Urban Centers**: Higher expectations for comprehensive services

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core International Standards
- Implement JCI, WHO, and ISO standards
- Remove regional bias from current system
- Update scoring algorithm

### Phase 2: Regional Integration
- Add regional accreditation bodies
- Implement regional adaptation frameworks
- Test with hospitals from different regions

### Phase 3: Advanced Metrics
- Integrate clinical outcomes data
- Add patient experience metrics
- Implement innovation scoring

### Phase 4: Continuous Improvement
- Regular updates based on global healthcare trends
- Feedback integration from international users
- Annual review and adjustment of weights

## Data Sources

### Primary Sources
- Official accreditation body databases
- WHO Global Health Observatory
- ISO certification databases
- Government health ministry databases

### Secondary Sources
- International hospital rankings (Newsweek, Forbes)
- Academic research on healthcare quality
- Patient review platforms (region-specific)
